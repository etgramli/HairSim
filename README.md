# Hair simulation
This is a hair simulation project.
The physics is implemented in OpenCL and the rendering is done with OpenGL.

## Implementation

### OpenCL
For the physics part a ICD is requred that supports a graphics card.
One graphics card is requred to run the program, but the manufacturer is not important.
No OpenCL extensions are used.

### OpenGL
